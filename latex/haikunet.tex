\section{Why Haikunet?}

The name Haikunet comes from the join of Haiku and Network. A Haiku is a Japanese poem with a lot of themes, but in most of the cases a Haiku describes the nature from the view of an observer. This is exactly what you are going to do with Haikunet, write short programs (almost poems), which will describe the desired nature of a network, and this description will be done from the point of view of an observer of the network, meaning a person which does not necessarily knows how to interact at a system level with it, and in most of the cases, doesn't know how to. This is the intent's programmer point of view of the network.
